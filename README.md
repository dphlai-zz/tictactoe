Hello!

Welcome to my first SEi project.

This is a simple tic tac toe game, designed to be played on a single computer by two players. A counter at the bottom of the screen tracks the number of wins for each player.

If you wish to reset the scores, simply click on the 'reset game' button below the grid.

Have fun!
