<h3>Hello!</h3>

Welcome to my first SEi project: *Tic Tac Toe*. This simple game has been written in `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`.

The game is designed to be played on a single device by two players; a counter at the bottom of the screen records the number of wins for each player. If you wish to reset the scores, simply click on the 'reset game' button below the grid.

Have fun! :grinning:
